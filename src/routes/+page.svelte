    <p class="text-white py-2">I mostly game or watch YouTube in my free time, and I sometimes decide randomly to code random stuff like this website for no particular reason. (I'm writing this at 00:11 CEST on a Wednesday Morning with class the next day)</p>
    <p class="text-white py-2"><a class="underline decoration-1" href="https://github.com/pingusurmars/docker-compose-stack">I also run a few services</a> here and there on an old PC that I call my "server" (he's old but works OK-ish for what I do)</p>
    <p class="text-white py-4">That's pretty much it, feel free to look around here in the other pages! (it's not like I can prevent you from doing it)</p>
