    <p class="text-white py-4">I'm PinguSurMars_ (or Pingu for short) and I make stuff in whatever language speaks the
        most to my soul.</p>
    <p class="text-white py-2">I mostly game or watch YouTube in my free time, and I sometimes decide randomly to code
        random stuff like this website for no particular reason. (I'm writing this at 00:11 CEST on a Wednesday Morning
        with class the next day)</p>

                                  href="https://github.com/pingusurmars/docker-compose-stack">I also run a few
        services</a> here and there on an old PC that I call my "server" (he's old but works OK-ish for what I do)</p>
    <p class="text-white py-4">That's pretty much it, feel free to look around here in the other pages! (it's not like I
        can prevent you from doing it)</p>

    <p class="py-4 text-white">Also here's a random file from my h5ai:</p>
