    <p class="text-white py-4">As you saw in the <a class="underlined" href="/">home page</a>, my name is Pingu(SurMars_), I'm some random teenager on the internet with sleep issues & random productivity spikes at 3 AM. I made this website to show off the stuff I've made/hosted or that I find cool. </p>
    <p class="text-white py-2">For my daily tech, I use an HP Victus 16 s0040-nf laptop as my daily coding/gaming PC. It has a 7000 Series Ryzen 7 7840HS with 16GB of RAM (that I plan on upgrading to 32) & 500GB of NVMe storage (who I also plan on upgrading to 2TB as 500 is NOT enough)</p>

    <p class="text-white py-2">(btw, this website is fully open source, made in Svelte (TS) & hosted on CF Pages/Workers! if you want to check the source code out, check the link that says "here" at the bottom of the page!)</p>
